# Parallax backgrounds with GBDK-2020
If you look out into the distance, and move around, you’ll notice that objects closer to you move slower than objects further from you. This effect is called “Parallax”

> Parallax is the observed displacement of an object caused by the change of the observer’s point of view. In astronomy, it is an irreplaceable tool for calculating distances of far away stars.
